            <h3>Ultrasonic Radar System using Arduino</h3>
            <p>Aimed at calculating the position and speed of an object<br>
                placed at a distance from the sensor.</p>
            <div class="project-details" id="details1">
                <p>The Ultrasonic Radar System using Arduino detects and tracks objects
                     using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor. The 
                     Arduino Uno controls the servo to rotate the sensor, measuring the 
                     distance of objects using ultrasonic pulses. The system calculates 
                     position using polar coordinates and estimates speed by analyzing 
                     successive readings. A radar-like interface built with Processing or 
                     Python GUI visually maps detected objects in real time. This system 
                     is useful for robotics, security, and obstacle detection applications.</p>

            <h3>Dual Axis Solar Tracker using Arduino</h3>
            <p>Aimed at programming the Arduino in such a way that <br>the 
                solar panel rotates in dual axis.</p>
            <div class="project-details" id="details2">
                <p>The Dual Axis Solar Tracker using Arduino uses LDR sensors to detect
                    sunlight direction and controls two servo motors to adjust the solar panel 
                    along horizontal and vertical axes for maximum efficiency. The Arduino Uno
                    processes sensor data and moves the panel accordingly, ensuring optimal solar
                    energy absorption throughout the day. This system improves energy generation by
                    keeping the panel aligned with the sun at all times.</p>

            <h3>Hotel Management System using Python</h3>
            <p>This project aimed at creating an effective Hotel <br>
                Management System with the use of Python Program.</p>
            <div class="project-details" id="details3">
                <p>The Hotel Management System using Python is designed to handle
                    room bookings, check-ins, check-outs, and billing efficiently. Built 
                    using Python with Tkinter or Flask, it integrates a database (SQLite/MySQL)
                    to store customer details, room availability, and transactions. The system 
                    enhances automation, reduces manual work, and improves hotel operations by 
                    providing a user-friendly interface for staff and guests.</p>

            <h3>IOT Home Automation System</h3>
            <p>Used ESP32 to build an IOT Home Automation System <br>using 
                cloud and a mobile app to send and receive data.</p>
            <div class="project-details" id="details4">
                <p>This IoT Home Automation System uses an ESP32 microcontroller, 
                    a cloud platform, and a mobile app to remotely control and monitor 
                    home appliances. The ESP32 connects to sensors (DHT11, motion sensors) and 
                    relay modules to collect data and switch appliances on/off. It communicates
                    with the Firebase cloud via Wi-Fi using MQTT or HTTP protocols, allowing
                    real-time data storage and remote access. The mobile app, built with Kodular
                    provides an interface for users to send commands and view live status updates, 
                    including temperature, security alerts, and scheduled automation.This system 
                    enhances energy efficiency, security, and convenience by enabling remote and 
                    automated control of home devices.</p>
